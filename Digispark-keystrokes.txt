//-- This is a cheatsheet for the keystrokes --\\

    Keystroke   letter:         KEY_A KEY_B KEY_C       ... etc
    Keystroke   number:         KEY_1 KEY_2 KEY_3       ... etc
    Keystroke   FN:             KEY_F1 KEY_F2 KEY_F3    ... etc  
    Keystroke   space:          KEY_SPACE
    Keystroke   enter:          KEY_ENTER
    Keystroke   left Windows:   MOD_GUI_LEFT
    Keystroke   right Windows:  MOD_GUI_RIGHT
    Keystroke   left control:   MOD_CONTROL_LEFT
    Keystroke   right control:  MOD_CONTROL_RIGHT
    Keystroke   left shift:     MOD_SHIFT_LEFT
    Keystroke   right shift:    MOD_SHIFT_RIGHT
    Keystroke   left alt:       MOD_ALT_LEFT
    Keystroke   right alt:      MOD_ALT_RIGHTS

To press two keys at once, seperate them with a comma in the script.

    //-- This keystroke opens up the Run prompt --\\
    DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_R , MOD_GUI_LEFT);

To press three keys at once, seperate the first two with a comma, and seperate the last with a | in the script.

    //-- This keystroke copies a screenshot to the clipboard --\\
    DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_S , MOD_GUI_LEFT | MOD_SHIFT_LEFT);


//-- This is a cheatsheet for the buildup of a payload file --\\

To make comments. you can start with /' , type in the comment after pressing enter and tab, press enter again and end with '/.
As an example:

/'
    This is an example comment.
'/

Another way (and simpler way) to make comments is by using //.
As an example:

// This is an example comment.



For payloads, ALWAYS start the script with: #include "DigiKeyboard.h". This is to ensure that the right library is loaded,
otherwise the payload wil not be able to type.

A part which is put in void loop to ensure the payload will run smoothly is the following;
  DigiKeyboard.update();
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(0);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(3000);

void setup is
void loop is 

So as an example for the makeup of the file:

/'
    This is an example file, it will open up Google.com.
'/

#include "DigiKeyboard"

void setup() {
    // Put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {

    DigiKeyboard.update();
    DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(0);
    DigiKeyboard.delay(3000);

    DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_R , MOD_GUI_LEFT); //starts Run
    DigiKeyboard.delay(100);
    DigiKeyboard.print(http://www.google.com);
    DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);
 
}
