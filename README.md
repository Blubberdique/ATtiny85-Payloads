# ATtiny85-Payloads
This is my repository for payloads made or edited by me. I do not take credit for edited payloads.

My idea for this repository is to make it accessible, educational and informative to any who are interested in the poor man's Rubber Ducky, be it those who
have no IT experience at all to those who know basically everything.


    The Digispark-keystrokes.txt file is made up of two parts. The first part is a cheatsheet to the keystrokes (work in progress), and the second part is an
    explanation to the build up of a payload and what the individual parts do (work in progress).


    !! --- NOTE! THIS FILE IS TESTED ON WINDOWS 10 ONLY! --- !!!
    Added a file called lazy-mans-updater.txt (work in progress) which is meant to be able to update through Windows updater, Intel Driver & Support Assistant
    and NVidia.

    I will add a file called "A guide to Digikeyboard coding" which will explain all the commands, keyboard shortcuts that can be made and some basic scripts.
